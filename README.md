# neural-networks

This is a project done all the way back in high school for my "Profielwerkstuk" (a kind of "high school thesis" in the Netherlands). It contains an implementation of basic multi-layer perceptron neural network training, including various settings for regularization and other optimizations. It also includes a module for graphically engaging with a trained neural network by letting it recognize characters that you draw yourself.
